## Note
This is the public online repository for our team's UWC_2.0 project. 

This repository will cointain all related documents, materials and folders for Requirement, System modelling and Architectural design.


## How to use
Code for the website is all in the folder CodeSpaces, as it is only pure html, css and js and static sites. 
You just need to download all the file and run it locally (no NodeJS need). We did not build backend server so
everything is lost after a reload
